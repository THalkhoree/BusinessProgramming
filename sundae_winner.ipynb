    "We will talk more about the ```import``` statement later lecture, but briefly it is a way of letting you use code from elsewhere.  We call this process ```import``` and the code form else where is bundled into a package or modules.    So in the following, some programmer worked out how to get the comuter to generate random numbers, and put this into a module called ```random```.  Since we want to use use we need to ```import``` the module."
