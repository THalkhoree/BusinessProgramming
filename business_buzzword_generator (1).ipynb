    "The Phrase Generator program can be extended to generate various types of phrases beyond buzzword combinations. For example:\n",
    "- It could be modified to generate simple recipes by using lists of ingredients, cooking methods, and serving suggestions.\n",
    "- Another possibility is to create an idea or project generator by using lists of concepts, actions, and outcomes relevant to the domain.\n",
    "- There's no need to limit it to three words; the program can be adapted to handle any number of lists and combine more words in the generated phrases.\n",
    "- The order of the words can matter depending on the desired output. For example, in recipes, the order of ingredients and steps is crucial, while in other cases, it might not matter as much.\n",
    "- Yes, we could create sentences by ensuring grammatical coherence and logical flow. These sentences could then be combined to create paragraphs or longer text, potentially enabling the program to write essays on specified topics.\n",
    "- All these extensions would contribute to making the program more versatile and 'smart' by allowing it to generate a wider range of content beyond simple phrases, making it useful in various contexts such as content generation, brainstorming, or even educational purposes."
